3D File Visualizer - Setup Script

This script installs all required dependencies for the 3D File Visualizer.
It checks for the presence of required packages and installs or upgrades them as needed.

First-time users must run this script before running 3d_art.py.

Usage:
    python setup.py install

Dependencies:
    - numpy (>=1.19.0)
    - matplotlib (>=3.3.0)
    - imageio (>=2.9.0)
    - Pillow (>=8.0.0)
    - scipy (>=1.5.0)
    - moviepy (>=1.0.3)
    - FFmpeg (external dependency, must be installed separately)

    Check for required dependencies and install/upgrade as needed.

    4. Uses pip to install missing packages and upgrade outdated ones
